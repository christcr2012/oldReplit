The platform aims to be a leading enterprise business operating system, providing high ROI for StreamCore providers who manage and scale deployments. The business vision is to achieve $10M ARR within 24 months, transforming from a proven MVP to a board-ready, enterprise-grade solution through systematic hardening, compliance, and market expansion.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

**Environment Variable Management:**
- Use Replit secrets for convenience while working in Replit
- Manually maintain .env file for cross-platform compatibility (GitHub/Vercel/Neon workflow)
- CRITICAL: Never clear, delete, or modify the .env file - user manages this manually
- Dual approach provides both Replit convenience and external development portability

## Release authority

Release authority (owner's standing rule, 2026-11-04): this project gets ONE automatic release per day (the nightly promotion). Every additional release requires the owner's authority — granted in advance with conditions, in the moment, or by any other scheme the owner specifies. Release machinery must encode the owner's permission scheme; no machinery may impose its own numeric cap on owner-ordered releases. Checks (exact-head green, ancestry, receipts) govern HOW an authorized release runs, never WHETHER the owner may order one.
